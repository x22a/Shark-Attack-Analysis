# Shark-Attack-Analysis

The goal of this project was to clean de data of the dataset in order to prove some hypothesis.

The main hypothesis was to show in which months there were the most attacks dependig on the hemisphere.

After extracting the month I crossed with the country where the attack happened, asigning a hemisphere using a dictionary.

I also extracted the values of the attacks depending of the person who was attacked, if they were male or female.

The last hypothesis proven was if the attack was deadly or not.

I used Pandas to work with the dataframe, Regex to extract info and Mathplotlib to show the graphs.
